#  Customer Purchase Prediction using Decision Tree
This is a learning project for building a Decision Tree Classifier using the UCI Bank Marketing Dataset to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit.

##  Dataset
- [Bank Marketing Dataset - UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing)
- File used: `bank-additional-full.csv`

##  Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

##  Project Steps
1. Data Loading and Exploration
2. One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables
3. Train/Test Split
4. Decision Tree Model Training
5. Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)
6. Visualization of the Tree and Feature Importance

##  Key Learnings
- Preprocessing real-world categorical data
- Splitting data to avoid overfitting
- Understanding how decision trees work internally
- Visualizing the decision-making process
